# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project implements a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**. It leverages advanced hand landmark detection models to identify, track, and visualize hand movements both from static images and live video streams.

## 🚀 Concept Overview

Human–computer interaction is evolving beyond traditional interfaces like keyboards and touchscreens. **Hand gesture recognition** enables seamless, contactless communication between humans and machines.  
This project demonstrates how computer vision and machine learning can interpret complex hand gestures in real-time by analyzing **key landmark positions** of the hand.

The model detects:
- **21 3D hand landmarks** per hand
- **Connections between joints** for gesture structure mapping
- **Multiple hands** simultaneously (left and right)

Using these landmarks, higher-level applications (like sign language recognition, virtual control interfaces, and gesture-based robotics) can be built.

## 🧠 Core Components

- **MediaPipe Hands** – Google’s on-device hand tracking solution providing real-time 3D landmark detection.
- **OpenCV** – Used for video input, color-space conversions, and result visualization.
- **Python** – Serves as the primary language to integrate and visualize the model output.

## ⚙️ Features

- Detects and tracks multiple hands in real-time.
- Estimates 3D hand landmarks from live video or image input.
- Visualizes landmarks and connections using MediaPipe’s drawing utilities.
- Can be extended for gesture classification or sign language translation.
